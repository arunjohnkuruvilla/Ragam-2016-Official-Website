			This year, our team of volunteers, comprising of 60 highly dedicated and compassionate students, were faced with the challenge of having to organising an event that would truly make a difference. 
After weeks of brainstorming, we settled upon the idea to conduct a spectacular Children's day for 150 children hailing from 4 orphanages in Calicut. We organised an excursion for them to the Regional Science Centre and Planetarium in Calicut. Initially overwhelmed by the responsibility we had to shoulder for this undertaking, the smiles on the children's faces throughout the day became constant reassurances for us. Seeing their eyes widen with amazement as they gazed at the simulated galaxies in the planetarium, we realized that even though we had aimed to make that day memorable for the children, they were the ones who made it truly memorable for us. 
Our venture was also aided by the restaurant Broast, in Mukkam, that had sponsored lunch for the children.

			As a part of Sneharagam, their cultural fest, Ragam 16's social initiative, a team of 50+ NITCians took it upon themselves to design beautiful, hand crafted cards. The cards were sold in different designs, for Rs. 100, 120 and 150 each, depending upon the complexity of the design. They had decided that the profit from cards, which cost little to make (as they did not have to pay for the labour), would entirely be donated to their chosen beneficiary. They sold the cards, in-college, and their exquisteness saw huge demand, which allowed the team to reach their self-assigned goal of raising Rs. 60000 for the treatment of a terminally ill child, recognized by Compassionate Kozhikode, a charity wing that is the brainchild of the Collector, with help from NITC's NSS wing, which also raised money to supplement the profit made from these cards.

			The Sneharagam 16 program will be held on March 13th. We will play host to over 200 differently abled students from across the Malabar region of Kerala. We are organizing a sociocultural program for them to showcase their talents. This fun filled program will include dance, Ganamela, skits among other events. The students participating in this program will be awarded mementos,gifts  and certificates. Through this initiative, we aim to create a sense of accomplishment and self worth amongst the students. And undoubtedly we shall also create memories for them to cherish. Through our interaction with these students, we also hope to spread the message that people with special needs deserve to be integrated into society and should be given the care and support they require to achieve that. This program shall mark the 4th edition of Sneharagam and we aspire to continue to uphold the legacy we created of recognising the needs of society and striving to meet them. And so may the Ragam flame also symbolise our burning desire to make a difference.
